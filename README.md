# Cancellation-of-the-Tonal-Component
This  study  addresses  the  development  of 
 algorithms  for  the  removal  of  tonal  components  from 
 acoustic  signals  through  active  narrowband  noise 
 reduction  methods.  The  core  technique  involves 
 introducing  a  compensating  sinusoid  to  the  original 
 signal,  with  parameters  derived  from  a  thorough 
 analysis.  However,  the  parameter  estimation  process 
 introduces a processing delay.
